# Instagram-Like-Stalker
The Instagram Like Checker Bot is a Python tool that automates checking if a specific user has liked posts on another account’s profile. Using Selenium and webdriver-manager, it logs in, collects posts, and scans like lists automatically. Easy to configure with a config.json or environment variables, it’s ideal for engagement tracking and research.
